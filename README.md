# Cluster Analysis Project: 
Unveiling Insights in Global Development Metrics

In the realm of data-driven decision-making, my Cluster Analysis project stands as a testament to the power of leveraging advanced analytical techniques for extracting meaningful patterns from complex datasets. The primary business objective is to create clusters within a global development measurement dataset, shedding light on intricate relationships between various economic and development metrics across countries worldwide.

## Business Objective:

The core aim of this project is to uncover inherent structures and relationships within the global development dataset. By employing cluster analysis, we seek to group countries with similar economic and developmental characteristics. This not only aids in identifying patterns and trends but also lays the foundation for targeted policy recommendations, strategic business decisions, and a deeper understanding of the factors influencing global development.

## Dataset Details:

The dataset is a treasure trove of information encompassing crucial economic and development metrics for countries worldwide. Variables include birth rate, business tax, CO2 emissions, days to start a business, ease of doing business, energy usage, GDP, health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, health expenditure per capita, hours to do tax, infant mortality, internet usage, lending rate, life expectancy (female), and more. This diverse set of variables offers a comprehensive view of the economic and developmental landscape.

## Acceptance Criterion:
Work on different clustering models, do a comparative analysis and need to deploy the clustering application on streamlit, flask etc.


## Clustering Models Exploration:

The project involves the exploration and implementation of various clustering models such as k-means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN.
Comparative analysis to understand the strengths and limitations of each model in the context of the dataset.
Interactive Deployment with Streamlit:

A crucial component of the project is the deployment of the clustering application on Streamlit, ensuring an interactive and user-friendly interface.
Users can dynamically explore and visualize the clusters, gaining insights into the relationships between different development metrics.
Feature Importance Analysis:

Uncover the most influential features driving the clustering process, providing a deeper understanding of the key factors shaping global development patterns.
Documentation and Reporting:

Thorough documentation of the clustering methodology, model parameters, and key findings.
Visual and intuitive reports that facilitate easy comprehension of complex clustering outcomes.
